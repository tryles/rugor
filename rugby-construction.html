            <h1>Rugby Construction Group Ltd.</h1>

            <h2>Start simple and build-out: web development, design, and documentation for an aspirational Vancouver construction group.</h2>

          </header>

          <p>Rugby Construction needed a website that could showcase not only their completed projects, but also their projects on-the-go. The philosophy behind this was that in-progress photos communicated the realities of building a home &mdash; something that customers could benefit from. As well, sales people and project managers could use in-progress photos to highlight building techniques that might suit a customer's needs. The cutting-edge building technologies used by the company were brought to attention through the blog, which also featured stories about the building methods used in basement dig-downs and glass solariums &mdash; work for which the company was known.</p>

          <p>The front page opened with a randomly selected gallery slideshow of completed projects.</p>

          <img src="img/rugby1.jpg" alt="Rugby Construction Group Ltd.">

          <p>While the project gallery sorted by completed and in-progress projects.</p>

          <img src="img/rugby2.jpg" alt="Rugby Construction Group Ltd.">

          <p>The single-project page featured a touch-scrolling image gallery, as well as 'inspiriation galleries' which were used by salespeople to direct customer requests.</p>

          <img src="img/rugby3.jpg" alt="Rugby Construction Group Ltd.">

          <p>As the name of the company suggests, the owners and staff were keen players of Rugby.</p>

          <img src="img/rugby4.jpg" alt="Rugby Construction Group Ltd.">

          <p>The company focused on building a community around their business and used much of their promotions budget to fund youth Rugby around the city. Jerseys were designed for a youth rugby team.</p>

          <img src="img/rugby5.jpg" alt="Rugby Construction Group Ltd.">

          <p>Additional designs were made for email and direct mail campaigns, construction hoarding (the display fencing that surrounds building sites), safety signage, sales pitch-books, sub-project identities and letterhead. A tradeshow booth was designed that featured an astroturf rugby pitch and 'locker room' &mdash; complete with custom digital displays &mdash; which was featured at tradeshows across the Lower Mainland.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>

          <p>The construction business is a competitive one, and effectively communicating a company's strengths helps to differentiate it from the rest of the field. A custom website build in conjunction with supplementary design material clearly articulated the company's philosophy that home building was a process rather than a finished product &mdash; and ultimately placed the customer's experience first.</p>
